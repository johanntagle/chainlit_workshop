## ROI Calculator

### Example: Mid-Size Restaurant

**Current Situation:**
- 50 calls/day with basic questions (hours, menu, reservations)
- Average 3 minutes per call = 150 minutes/day = 2.5 hours

- Estimated 10 missed after-hours calls/week = 40/month
- Average party size of 4 × $80 check = $320/booking
- Recovery of just 25% = 10 bookings = $3,200/month

**With AI Agent:**
- Staff time saved: $1,500/month
- Additional bookings: $3,200/month (conservative)
- **Total Value: $4,700/month**

AI agent integrated with their website and trained on their menu, FAQ, and catering information.

## Appendix: Technical FAQs

### How is this different from chatbots I've seen before?

Older chatbots used decision trees ("Press 1 for hours, 2 for location"). Modern AI uses natural language understanding - customers can ask anything, any way, and get helpful answers.

### What if my booking system doesn't integrate?

We can still provide value! The AI collects booking requests (name, phone, date, time, party size) and emails them to you. You confirm manually. Still saves time vs phone tag.

### Can it handle phone calls, not just chat?

Yes! We can add phone integration (via Twilio) for an additional $200/month. The AI can handle voice calls using the same knowledge base.

### What happens if the AI fails?

Multiple safety nets:
- If AI is unsure, it says so and offers human contact
- If technical issues, visitors see phone number and email
- We monitor uptime and get alerts
- 99.9% uptime guarantee

### Do I need technical knowledge to manage it?

No! We handle all technical aspects. You update business info through a simple form (like updating a Google Business listing).
